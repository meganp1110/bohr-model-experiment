# Bohr Model Experiment

This project analyzes hydrogen emission spectra measured in an optical spectroscopy experiment designed to test the Bohr model of the atom.

A Jupyter Notebook was used to perform wavelength calibration, linear fitting, and uncertainty analysis in order to extract an experimental value of the Rydberg constant from measured Balmer lines.
